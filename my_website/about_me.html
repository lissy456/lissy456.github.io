<p> The San Francisco bridge was first opened to the public in 1937. This awe-astonishing display was named one of the seven civil engineering spectacles of the world by the American Societies of Civil Engineers in 1994. </p>
<p>The construction of the world's largest suspension bridge (at that time) was thought to be impossible. However depsite the doubt among the audience and the great depression the project was still executed by Joseph Strauss whom was able to find financial funds and support. It took thousands of workers, 4 years, and 35 mllion workers to complete this project. The bridge's finalized constrcution was inaugurated on May 27, 1937 where 18,000 people got to walk across it to commorate the success. On the following day the Golden Gate Bridge was finally accessible for motorized traffic. Today more than 12,000 cars cross through it.  </p>
